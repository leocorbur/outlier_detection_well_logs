## 🔗 Access the App and Manual

- **Access the App:** To start using the app, click [here](https://outlier-detection-well-logs.streamlit.app).
- **App Manual:** For a detailed explanation of how to use this app, click [here](./src/outlier_app.pptx). Note that the manual is available in Spanish.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The app utilizes the following machine learning models for outlier detection:

- **Isolation Forest**
- **OneClass SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **LOF (Local Outlier Factor)**

## 🛠️ Interact with Hyperparameters

Users can interact with the hyperparameters of each machine learning model to customize the outlier detection process according to their specific needs. Explore the options available in the app to fine-tune the models and optimize outlier detection results.

- **Outlier Detection:** Automatically or manually detect and visualize outliers in your data.
- **Data Cleaning:** Options to remove or adjust detected outliers.
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts, boxplots and scatterplot to understand your data better.

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Access the App:** Open the Streamlit app.
2. **Upload Data:** Load your well log files.
3. **Analyze:** Use the tools provided to detect and manage outliers in your dataset.
4. **Visualize Outliers:** View visualizations highlighting the detected outliers in your well log data.
